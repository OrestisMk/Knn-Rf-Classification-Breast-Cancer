Machine learning coursework submission

Submitted by: Orestis Makris

There are five Matlab files in the submission that should run independently, included our scaling function 
(normalise.m). 
K-NN is under (KNN.m) and (KNN_FeatureSelection.m) for the feature reduced dataset. For random forest we have 
(RF.m) and (RF_FeatureSelection). In additon you have our dataframe (Breast_cancer2.csv), and my readme file.
